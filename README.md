# SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2022
### Organisation : Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES).
### Problem Statement Title : Automated Identification of Fish Species (AutoFiS)
### Team Name : Code for Good!

### Description
#### Development of this application was divided into two parts Machine Learning predictive model and Android app development.
#### Machine Learning consist building of a model from custom dataset of anotated pictures of fish species in such a way that it takes a image as input and predict the specie as output. Here to build this model we have used technologies like tensorflow and MobileNetV2(a pretrained model).
#### For building the application we have used Android Studio( with JAVA ) and Firebase to store user information. For implementing the ML model into android app we used tflite framework.
#### This app is designed in such a way that the processing of image , generating prediction and retrieving or storing of user data is handled asynchrounously which makes the application faster and provide clean user interface.
